📘 Project Report: Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard
1. Project Overview
The Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Excel-based analytical tool designed to evaluate overall business performance for a pizza outlet. The goal of this project was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights using Excel’s data cleaning, analysis, and visualization capabilities.
This dashboard provides insights into:
Total orders received
Total units sold
Total earnings
Monthly and daily sales trends
Category-wise and size-wise distribution of pizzas
Best-selling pizza names

2. Objective of the Project
To analyze pizza sales and identify important trends.
To clean and organize raw sales data using Excel.
To apply Excel formulas, PivotTables, and charts to extract insights.
To create a visually appealing and interactive dashboard for presentation.
To assist business owners/managers in data-driven decision making.

3. Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel
Data Cleaning
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
Slicers & Filters
Data Modeling (relationships, if any)
Conditional Formatting
Trend Analysis
Dashboard Design & Layout

4. Dataset Description
The raw dataset contained several fields such as:
Order ID
Date
Pizza Name
Pizza Category (Veggie, Supreme, Chicken, Classic)
Pizza Size (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
Quantity Ordered
Unit Price
Total Price
This data formed the foundation for creating the dashboard metrics.

5. Steps Followed in Creating the Dashboard
Step 1: Data Cleaning
I performed the following cleaning operations:
Removed duplicates and blank records.
Standardized column names for consistency.
Checked and converted data types (dates formatted properly).
Treated missing values (if any).
Verified consistency in category and size formats.

Step 2: Data Preparation
I created additional calculated columns such as:
Month Name → using =TEXT(Date, "MMM")
Day Name → using =TEXT(Date, "DDD")
Revenue → Quantity × Unit Price
Year (if required)
These fields were later used for PivotTables.

Step 3: Creating Pivot Tables
To analyze the dataset, multiple PivotTables were created:
1. Orders Received
Count of unique Order IDs
2. Units Sold
Sum of Quantity Ordered
3. Total Earnings
Sum of Total Price
4. Month-wise Sales
Month vs Revenue
5. Day-wise Sales
Day of Week vs Revenue
6. Category-wise Pizza Sales
Pizza Category vs % Contribution
7. Size-wise Pizza Sales
Pizza Size vs % Contribution
8. Top Pizza Names
Pizza Name ordered highest number of times
Each PivotTable was formatted for clarity and readability.

Step 4: Creating Pivot Charts
From each PivotTable, relevant charts were created:
Pie chart for category-wise sales
Donut chart for size-wise sales
Line chart for month-wise sales trends
Column chart for day-wise performance
Card visuals for KPIs (Orders, Units, Earnings)
Colors, fonts, and designs were matched for uniform theme.

Step 5: Developing the Dashboard Layout
I created a single-page dashboard using the following approach:
Added a header section titled Pizza Sales Analysis with a thematic image.
Arranged KPI cards at the top for quick insights.
Placed charts symmetrically for a clean layout.
Used a dark color theme with contrasting charts for better visibility.
Aligned and grouped objects for a professional look.

Step 6: Applying Slicers and Interactivity
To make the dashboard interactive:
Added slicers for Pizza Category and Pizza Size.
Connected slicers to multiple PivotTables.
Customized slicer formatting to match the dashboard theme.

Step 7: Final Formatting & Enhancement
Applied consistency in fonts, colors, and chart styles.
Added labels and titles for better understanding.
Highlighted key values using bold fonts and bright colors.
Ensured gridlines were removed for a cleaner dashboard appearance.
Protected sheet (optional) to maintain layout integrity.




6. Key Insights from the Dashboard
Total Orders: 21,350
Units Sold: 49,574
Total Earnings: ₹8,17,860.05
Best Performing Months: July and June
Best Day for Sales: Friday

These insights highlight customer preferences and can help optimize inventory, offers, and marketing campaigns.
